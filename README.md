Code to perform semi-automated literature reviews

# Getting Started
I use [conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html) to manage my python environment. Once you have conda installed on your machine, run ...
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This will create a conda environment named ```pm_env```, which you can activate using ...
```
source activate pm_env
```
