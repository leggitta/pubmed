Code to perform semi-automated literature reviews

NOTE: Some notebooks in this repository use the [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) library for visualizations. Github will not render bokeh plots, but if you'd like to see these visualizations without running the notebooks yourself, you can copy and paste the notebook link to [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

# Getting Started
I use [conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html) to manage my python environment. Once you have conda installed on your machine, run ...
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This will create a conda environment named ```pmc_env```, which you can activate using ...

```
source activate pmc_env
```
